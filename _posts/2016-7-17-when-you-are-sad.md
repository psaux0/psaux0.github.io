When you are sad   
you do not want to get out of your bed  
because you believe  
time will fly faster when you sleep  
and time is the best cure that can help you  
However, sleep never comes to you  

When you are sad  
mashed potatoes does not taste like what it should taste like  
kernel corns become sands  
you know you are hungry  
but you never eat  
You are fed by something else  

When you are sad  
your eyes turn red  
your heart is feeling sour  
you want to cry  
you want to cry  

When you are sad  
the sun is shining  
birds are singing  
love is around  

When you are sad  
you know that  
the simle will always come back
